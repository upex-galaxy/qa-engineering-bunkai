## Description

ATP for [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-38#icft=BK-38](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-38#icft=BK-38): TMS-Run Reporting | Filter project runs with pass/fail totals

1. 

| ATC ID  | Type  | Scenario  | Coverage Target  | Priority  | Automation  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BK-38-ATC-01  | Happy  | View all project Runs with row details and totals  | Project report baseline  | High  | UI/API/DB  |
| BK-38-ATC-02  | Integration  | Combined filters narrow rows and recompute totals  | Filter contract  | High  | UI/API/DB  |
| BK-38-ATC-03  | Negative  | Empty filter result shows zero rows and zero totals  | Empty state and stale totals  | High  | UI/API  |
| BK-38-ATC-04  | Boundary  | started_at date range includes start/end dates and excludes outside dates  | Date semantics  | Medium  | API/DB  |
| BK-38-ATC-05  | Happy  | Clear filters restores full list and totals  | Reset behavior  | Medium  | UI/API  |
| BK-38-ATC-06  | Negative  | Project with no Runs shows first-use empty state  | No-runs state  | Medium  | UI  |
| BK-38-ATC-07  | Security  | Cross-project Runs are excluded from rows and totals  | Data isolation  | High  | API/DB  |
| BK-38-ATC-08  | Performance  | Large Run set returns paginated/performant report  | Scalability  | Low  | API/DB  |

1. 

- Reporting scope is one Project
- Rows and totals are calculated from the same filtered query
- Date range filters Run started_at inclusively; timestamps stored in UTC, interpreted from Project timezone
- Pass/fail totals count only final passed and failed Runs
- running, blocked, skipped, aborted Runs may appear in rows/status filters but excluded from pass/fail totals
- Each Run stores a module_id snapshot at creation time for reporting
- Executor type enum is human, agent, ci
- No-runs and no-matches empty states both show pass total 0 and fail total 0
- Report reads enforce Project/workspace access boundaries
