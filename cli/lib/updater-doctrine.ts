/**
 * @fileoverview Unresolved-doctrine ledger for `AGENTS.md`.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. A drift row on a watched file fires ONCE per upstream change:
 * `detectProtectedDrift` stamps a sha marker and the row retires. For most
 * watched files that is right — they are project identity, and the operator's
 * `keep project` is a real answer. `AGENTS.md` is not like them. It is the
 * instruction file EVERY session loads, and skills cite rules by name. Answer
 * `keep project` to a doctrine hunk and the row retires FOREVER while the rule
 * is still absent, so the skills keep citing a rule the project does not have
 * and nothing ever says so again.
 *
 * THE LEDGER. Doctrine debt is tracked by CONTENT, not by the sha marker: a
 * section upstream has and this project does not is recorded in
 * `.template/doctrine-ledger.json` and re-surfaces on every run until the
 * section is actually THERE. Stamping the marker no longer retires it; writing
 * the doctrine does.
 *
 * PROPORTIONATE, because nagging is real and the one-shot design exists for a
 * reason:
 *
 *  - ONE aggregated row for the whole file, never one per section, never the
 *    full diff again. It is a line naming the absent sections and how many runs
 *    they have been absent.
 *  - Informational, never blocking. It never stops a sync.
 *  - Only sections upstream ADDED and the project entirely LACKS. A section
 *    present with different wording is the project's own prose on a rule it
 *    does have; the ordinary drift row already covers that, once.
 *  - It clears itself with no ceremony: write the section, and the next run
 *    finds it and drops it from the ledger.
 *
 * L0 HEADINGS ONLY, by construction. Upstream's `AGENTS.md` is the always-on
 * L0: the doctrine that moved into `.agents/instructions/` arrives synced
 * (the `instructions` component), so it can never be debt. A pre-split
 * project's ledger entries for the old numbered sections resolve on the first
 * run against the L0 (upstream no longer has them in this file), and what it
 * still lacks are the L0 headings themselves (`LOAD PROTOCOL`, `ROUTER`): the
 * migration row (`updater-instructions.ts`) maps the rest.
 *
 * SCOPED TO `AGENTS.md` ONLY. The argument for the ledger is that this one file
 * is loaded by every session and cited by every skill, so its divergence is
 * silent and compounding. No other watched file has that property: a KATA base,
 * a CI workflow or an MCP registry diverges loudly, at the point of use. A
 * ledger on those would be nagging with none of the justification.
