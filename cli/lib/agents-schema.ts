/**
 * @fileoverview The schema half of `.agents/project.yaml`: one full-depth key
 * walk, one generated `.agents/project.schema.yaml`, and the asymmetric diff
 * that tells a downstream project which keys upstream added since it was
 * scaffolded.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `.agents/project.yaml` is `bootstrapOnly`: the sync never
 * overwrites it, because it holds the project's identity. Upstream keeps
 * ADDING structural blocks to it, so a project scaffolded before a block
 * existed never learns it should have one. Today that is patched by one
 * hand-written back-fill hook per block in `cli/update-boilerplate.ts`, and
 * `orchestration:` is the proof the mechanism does not scale: it is the newest
 * block and nobody wrote its hook.
 *
 * THREE INVARIANTS, each paid for by a measurement:
 *
 *  1. NEVER `parseDocument(...).toString()` on a file under `.agents/`. The
 *     Document API preserves comments and silently reformats everything else:
 *     on the real `project.yaml` it rewraps the folded `git_strategy`
 *     description and rewrites `[main]` as `[ main ]`; on
 *     `jira-required.yaml` it GROWS the file by 2271 bytes while changing
 *     nothing. The parser is a LOCATOR; every write is a string splice at the
 *     offsets it reports, and the result is re-parsed to verify.
 *
 *  2. A PARSE FAILURE IS LOUD. `configEntries` in `updater-parity.ts` falls
 *     back to a regex line scan that only sees two levels, so a broken yaml
 *     silently NARROWS the diff and then reports success. Here a parse error
 *     returns `null` with the reason attached and the caller skips the file.
 *
 *  3. PROJECT-CHOSEN KEY NAMES ARE WILDCARDED. `environments:` key names are
 *     the project's (`uat`, not `qa`). A literal path diff would demand
 *     `environments.qa.web_url` from a project that deliberately has no `qa`,
 *     which turns the feature into noise on every run, and noise gets
 *     `--auto`'d away. The leaf SET is compared against each environment the
 *     project declares; the environment NAMES never are.
 *
 * The 2-level walk in `updater-parity.ts` stays exactly where it is: it is
 * right for MCP registries and permission blocks, where depth 3 really is
 * noise. It is wrong for THIS file, where 46 of 93 key paths sit at depth 3+ —
 * including `git_strategy.policy.direct_push_to_protected`, the key Critical
 * Rule #5 resolves every push against.

 * would be the bug.
 *
 * So the field list is not stale and deriving it wholesale would make the

 * Add a placeholder upstream, and either the installer prompts for it or a line
 * lands here saying who does. Silence stops being an option.
