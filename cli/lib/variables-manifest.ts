/**
 * @fileoverview Canonical variable manifest — the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for
 * every environment variable this repo knows about and where each one must go.
 *
 * Per handoff decision D1 (`.scratch/handoff-installer-variables-automation.md`):
 * this typed module replaces the four disconnected, drift-prone lists that used
 * to scatter var routing across the codebase (`INSTALLER_DEFERRED_VARS`,
 * `MCP_SERVER_SECRETS`, `DAY_ZERO_*`, and `doctor.ts`'s `PROJECT_BOUND_VARS`).
 *
 * Consumers (wired in later phases — NOT this phase):
 *   - `cli/install.ts`          → manifest-driven collection + closing summary.
 *   - `cli/doctor.ts`           → required-var health checks.
 *   - `cli/update-boilerplate.ts` → `.env` drift detection on update.
 *
 * `.env.example` stays the human-facing doc humans copy from; `scripts/check-vars.ts`
 * asserts manifest ⇄ `.env.example` parity so they never drift (D1).
 *
 * Remote target for THIS repo (QA) = GitHub Actions secrets (`gh secret set`),
 * because the test suites run in GitHub Actions. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is deliberately
 * EXCLUDED from the manifest: it is auto-injected by Actions and must never be
 * pushed (see the comment on the local-only block below).
 *
 * EVERY variable carries a `scope` (ADR-0005), and the scope decides who may
 * validate it and where:
 *   - `core`     the framework needs it. Validated at import with a default
 *                (TEST_ENV) or, behind a `featureGate`, by the code path that
 *                turns the feature on (Xray sync, Jira scripts, portal publish).
 *   - `tooling`  a tool that can get its credential elsewhere (a harness-level
 *                MCP, a CLI login, a CI-only notifier). Never a blocker.
 *   - `project`  the application under test: its login, its database, its API.
 *                Declared here as typed EXAMPLES so a copied `.env` validates;
 *                the consumer that reads one fails by name (`config.testUser`).
 * The doctor exits 1 for NO credential of any scope; the installer offers and
 * never requires; the schema requires only unconditional core items.

 * - `atlassian-instance` — resolved by `cli/lib/atlassian-instance.ts` from
 *   `.agents/project.yaml` -> `issue_tracker.atlassian_url`.
 *
 * The second case exists because `ATLASSIAN_URL` is deliberately NOT a local
 * variable: while it sat in `.env`, a stale copy in the process environment
 * shadowed the corrected file (both `bun`'s autoload and varlock skip a var
 * that is already set), and `jira:sync-issues` silently rebuilt the PBI
 * cache from a dead Jira site with exit code 0. The host is project identity,
 * so it is anchored to a versioned file that shows up in a diff.
 *
 * The NAME keeps a `github` destination because a CI step or third-party action
 * may still want the variable in its environment. Its value is pushed there FROM
 * the yaml, so the two cannot drift. The repo's own test runtime does not rely on
