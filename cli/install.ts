/**
 * Project installer for agentic-qa-boilerplate.
 *
 * Drives the end-to-end onboarding for a freshly-cloned QA boilerplate across
 * 5 named phases:
 *
 *   PHASE 1 — DETECTION
 *     1-repo-verify     Verify repo root (package.json name / installer.lock.json)
 *     2-gentle-ai-detect  Detect the engram binary (presence + version)
 *     3-gentle-ai-install engram install instructions / skip decision
 *     4-agent-detect    Detect agents (Claude Code / OpenCode / Codex) and prompt selection
 *
 *   PHASE 2 — INSTALLATION
 *     5-deps-install    Install dependencies (`bun install`)
 *     6-playwright      Install Playwright browsers (`bun run pw:install`)
 *     8-skills-gentle-ai Wire Engram memory per agent via `engram setup` (or skip)
 *     9-skills-community Install community skills via `bunx skills add`
 *
 *   PHASE 3 — CONFIGURATION
 *     10-mcp-env        Wire `.env` for MCP servers
 *     13-github-repo    GitHub repository (optional)
 *
 *   PHASE 4 — VERIFICATION
 *     11-verify-clis    Verify external CLIs (bun, gh, acli, playwright-cli, resend, jq)
 *     14-state-write    Persist `.template/installer.state.json`
 *
 *   PHASE 5 — INITIAL CONFIGURATION
 *     7-agents-setup    Run agents:setup (.agents/project.yaml populator)
 *     12.4-acli-auth    Atlassian credentials + acli session login
 *     13-jira-sync        Catalog-source prompt (own / upex / skip) → fields +
 *                         workflows + link-types sync; empty {} placeholders for
 *                         any catalog still missing (anti STALE-PATH)
 *     14-jira-check     `bun run jira:check`
 *
 * The `*-gentle-ai*` step keys predate the switch to `engram setup`; they keep
 * their names so `.template/installer.state.json` and `--force-step` stay
 * backward compatible.
 *
 * Idempotency: each step writes an ISO timestamp to state.steps[<key>] on success.
 * Re-runs skip completed steps unless overridden via:
 *   INSTALL_FORCE_ALL=1                  Clear all step timestamps before running
 *   INSTALL_FORCE_<STEP_KEY>=1           Clear one step (e.g. INSTALL_FORCE_5_DEPS_INSTALL=1)
 *   --force (CLI flag)                   Same as INSTALL_FORCE_ALL=1
 *   --force-step <key> (CLI flag)        Same as INSTALL_FORCE_<key>=1
 *   --validate-skills (CLI flag)         Smoke-test mode: probe skills.sh, no install
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run setup
 *   bun run setup --non-interactive
 *   bun run setup --force
 *   bun run setup --force-step 5-deps-install
 *   bun run setup --validate-skills
 *
 * Non-interactive env vars:
 *   INSTALL_AGENTS=claude-code,opencode,codex   Comma-list of agents to configure
 *   INSTALL_SKIP_ENGRAM=1                 Treat Engram as skipped (legacy alias: INSTALL_SKIP_GENTLE_AI=1)
 *   INSTALL_SKIP_DEPS=1                   Skip `bun install`
 *   INSTALL_SKIP_PLAYWRIGHT=1             Skip `bun run pw:install`
 *   INSTALL_SKIP_AGENTS_SETUP=1           Skip `bun run agents:setup`
 *   INSTALL_FORCE_AGENTS_SETUP=1          Re-run agents:setup even if state shows it ran
 *   INSTALL_FORCE_ENGRAM=1                Re-run `engram setup` even if state shows it ran (legacy alias: INSTALL_FORCE_GENTLE_AI=1)
 *   INSTALL_FORCE_COMMUNITY=1             Re-run community skill install even if state shows it ran
 *   INSTALL_FORCE_GITHUB=1                Re-run GitHub remote setup even if a remote is already wired
 *   INSTALL_SKIP_COMMUNITY=1              Skip `bunx skills add` step
 *   INSTALL_SKIP_JIRA=1                   Skip optional Jira bootstrap
 *   INSTALL_SKIP_API=1                    Skip optional API auth bootstrap
 *   INSTALL_SECRETS_PROVIDER=1password    Opt in to a secret manager (default: .env); with
 *   INSTALL_SECRETS_VAULT=<vault>         the vault its references point at
